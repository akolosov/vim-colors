# Pack of 140+ colorschemes for VIM

This is just a collection of all the vim colorschemes I've been collecting over time from the web.

## How to get them all

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/akolosov/vim-colors.git 
    cp ~/vim-colors/colors/* ~/.vim/colors/

Create the `colors/` directory inside ~/.vim/ if it doesn't exist.
